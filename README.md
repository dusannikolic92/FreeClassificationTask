# FreeClassificationTask
This is a Free Classification Task I used in my dissertation. The entire code is written in jspsych 6.3. and the experiment was hosted on Cognition.run platform.
The entire task is taken from the https://github.com/pwdonh/audio_tokens and adapted to fit the purposes of my research. The free classification task is described in this paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373549821_PERCEPTUAL_SIMILARITY_SPACE_OF_SERBIAN_LEXICAL_PITCH_ACCENTS_EVIDENCE_FROM_SERBIAN_AND_FRENCH_LISTENERS
